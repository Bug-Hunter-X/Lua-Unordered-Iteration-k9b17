This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Lua related to the unpredictable iteration order of the `pairs` iterator when used with nested tables.  The `bug.lua` file contains code that recursively iterates over a nested table using `pairs`.  Because the order of iteration is not guaranteed, the outcome of the function might be unpredictable across different Lua versions or even different runs of the same code. The `bugSolution.lua` file provides a solution.
